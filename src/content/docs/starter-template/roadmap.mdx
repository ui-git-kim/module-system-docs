This page outlines planned features and improvements for the starter template. Items are grouped by priority and complexity.

<Aside type="note">
This roadmap reflects current plans and may change based on community feedback and module requirements.

## Planned

Features planned for upcoming releases.

### Multiple Layouts

**Priority:** High

Currently the template has a single dashboard layout with sidebar navigation. This enhancement will add:

- **Builder/Editor Layout** - Full-bleed canvas for visual editors (already have `FullBleed` component)
- **Wizard Layout** - Step-based flows for onboarding or multi-step forms
- **Focus Layout** - Minimal chrome for focused tasks (reading, writing)
- **Landing Layout** - Marketing pages without app navigation

**Implementation approach:**
- Layout registry for registering layout components
- Route-level layout selection
- Nested layouts for flexibility

### Dashboard Widget Admin

**Priority:** High

Admin panel page for managing dashboard widgets:

- View all registered widgets
- Toggle widget visibility globally (hide from all users)
- Reorder widget default positions
- Set default visibility for new users

### Database Health Page

**Priority:** High

Admin panel page for monitoring database health:

- Connection status and pool metrics
- Table sizes and row counts
- Recent migration history
- Basic query performance stats
- Prisma connection info

### Permissions Module Integration

**Priority:** High

Prepare the template for granular permissions beyond basic roles:

- `managed` role support is already in place
- Hook points for permission checks in navigation
- Permission-aware UI components
- Backend middleware integration points

### Error Pages & Offline Handling

**Priority:** Medium

Proper error boundaries and user-facing error pages:

- Network failure page (no internet connection — currently auth silently fails)
- Auth error page (JWKS fetch failure, token expired, invalid session)
- 404 page (replace current plain `<div>404</div>` with styled page)
- 500 / unexpected error boundary with retry action
- React Router `errorElement` integration on protected routes
- Offline detection banner or toast notification

### Deployment Guide

**Priority:** Medium

Documentation page covering production deployment:

- Pre-deployment checklist (env vars, migrations, build verification)
- Deployment steps (backend first, then frontend)
- Post-deployment verification (health check, auth flow, critical paths)
- Security hardening checklist (rate limiting, CORS, monitoring)
- Error monitoring integration patterns (Sentry, structured logging)

### Internationalisation (i18n)

**Priority:** Medium

Add foundation for multi-language support:

- Language options registry (already exists)
- Translation file structure
- React context for current locale
- Backend response localisation hooks

### Notification System

**Priority:** Medium

Built-in notification infrastructure:

- Toast notifications (already using sonner)
- Persistent notification centre
- Notification preferences (registry exists)
- Backend notification service hooks

### Command Palette

**Priority:** Low

Global keyboard-driven navigation:

- `Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K` trigger
- Search across navigation items
- Recent items and actions
- Extensible via registry

### App Documentation

**Priority:** Low

Optional documentation setup for apps created from the template:

- Create script prompts: "Would you like to set up documentation?"
- Scaffolds Astro/Starlight docs folder (same setup as module system docs)
- App-specific docs, not linked to module system shared docs
- Pre-configured with app name and basic structure
- Separate from the shared module system documentation

**Current state:** Apps inherit the `docs/` submodule from the template, which points to the shared module system docs. Apps should either have no docs folder or their own dedicated docs.

## Under Consideration

Ideas being evaluated for feasibility and demand.

### Theme & Style Hook Points

Prepare the starter template for the [Style module](/modules/roadmap/#style):

- **`theme.changed` frontend action** — fired when the active theme/style configuration changes, so modules can react (re-render components, update cached styles, sync UI)
- **`admin.styleUpdated` backend action** — fired when admin saves style configuration (shadcn config, CSS variable overrides), following the same pattern as `admin.settingsUpdated`
- **Filter hook for CSS variables** — `filterRegistry.apply('theme.cssVariables', variables)` lets modules inject or modify CSS custom properties at build time

The existing light/dark mode toggle is a separate user preference and stays unchanged. The style module handles the broader theme configuration: shadcn component styling (`components.json`), colour palette overrides, border radius, typography, and other design tokens applied via `globals.css`.

<Aside type="note">
This is a hook-point preparation item — the starter template defines the conventions and wires the hook points, but the [Style module](/modules/roadmap/#style) provides the admin UI and actual theme management.
</Aside>

### Audit Logging

Track important actions:

- User activity logging
- Admin action audit trail
- Configurable log levels per feature
- Integration with external logging services

### Real-time Updates

WebSocket infrastructure for live features:

- Connection management
- Channel subscriptions
- Presence indicators
- Event broadcasting hooks

### CLI Scaffolding

Code generation for common patterns:

- `npm run generate:feature` - Create feature folder structure
- `npm run generate:registry` - Add new registry
- `npm run generate:page` - Add settings/admin page
