import { Aside, Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This page outlines planned features and improvements for the starter template. Items are grouped by priority and complexity.

<Aside type="note">
This roadmap reflects current plans and may change based on community feedback and module requirements.
</Aside>

## In Progress

Features currently being developed or designed.

### Multiple Layouts

**Status:** Planning

Currently the template has a single dashboard layout with sidebar navigation. This enhancement will add:

- **Builder/Editor Layout** - Full-bleed canvas for visual editors (already have `FullBleed` component)
- **Wizard Layout** - Step-based flows for onboarding or multi-step forms
- **Focus Layout** - Minimal chrome for focused tasks (reading, writing)
- **Landing Layout** - Marketing pages without app navigation

**Implementation approach:**
- Layout registry for registering layout components
- Route-level layout selection
- Nested layouts for flexibility

---

## Planned

Features planned for upcoming releases.

### Dashboard Widget Admin

**Priority:** High

Admin panel page for managing dashboard widgets:

- View all registered widgets
- Toggle widget visibility globally (hide from all users)
- Reorder widget default positions
- Set default visibility for new users

### Database Health Page

**Priority:** High

Admin panel page for monitoring database health:

- Connection status and pool metrics
- Table sizes and row counts
- Recent migration history
- Basic query performance stats
- Prisma connection info

### Unified Order Convention

**Priority:** Medium

Standardise the `order` property across all registries:

- Single, consistent order range convention for all registries
- Navigation, widgets, toolbar, settings pages all use same ranges
- Simplifies developer/LLM understanding
- Admins can override via admin panel regardless

Current state: Each registry has slightly different range conventions. Goal: One set of ranges that applies everywhere.

### Permissions Module Integration

**Priority:** High

Prepare the template for granular permissions beyond basic roles:

- `managed` role support is already in place
- Hook points for permission checks in navigation
- Permission-aware UI components
- Backend middleware integration points

### Internationalisation (i18n)

**Priority:** Medium

Add foundation for multi-language support:

- Language options registry (already exists)
- Translation file structure
- React context for current locale
- Backend response localisation hooks

### Notification System

**Priority:** Medium

Built-in notification infrastructure:

- Toast notifications (already using sonner)
- Persistent notification centre
- Notification preferences (registry exists)
- Backend notification service hooks

### Command Palette

**Priority:** Low

Global keyboard-driven navigation:

- `Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K` trigger
- Search across navigation items
- Recent items and actions
- Extensible via registry

### App Documentation

**Priority:** Medium

Optional documentation setup for apps created from the template:

- Create script prompts: "Would you like to set up documentation?"
- Scaffolds Astro/Starlight docs folder (same setup as module system docs)
- App-specific docs, not linked to module system shared docs
- Pre-configured with app name and basic structure
- Separate from the shared module system documentation

**Current state:** Apps inherit the `docs/` submodule from the template, which points to the shared module system docs. Apps should either have no docs folder or their own dedicated docs.

---

## Under Consideration

Ideas being evaluated for feasibility and demand.

### Theme System Enhancement

Expand beyond light/dark mode:

- Custom colour schemes
- Per-user theme preferences
- Admin-defined brand themes
- Theme registry for module contributions

### Audit Logging

Track important actions:

- User activity logging
- Admin action audit trail
- Configurable log levels per feature
- Integration with external logging services

### Real-time Updates

WebSocket infrastructure for live features:

- Connection management
- Channel subscriptions
- Presence indicators
- Event broadcasting hooks

### CLI Scaffolding

Code generation for common patterns:

- `npm run generate:feature` - Create feature folder structure
- `npm run generate:registry` - Add new registry
- `npm run generate:page` - Add settings/admin page

## Known Issues

Technical debt and minor inconsistencies to be addressed in future releases. These don't affect functionality but will be improved for consistency.

| Issue | Target | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Order convention varies by registry** | Unified Order Convention (planned) | Different registries use different default orders (Navigation: 50, Dashboard: 10, Settings: 100). Goal is one consistent 0-100 scale everywhere. |
| **Default order values undocumented** | Documentation update | Need a clear table showing each registry's default order value in the Registry Reference. |

<Aside type="note">
Admin overrides take precedence over developer-set order values, so these inconsistencies don't affect end-user experience.
</Aside>
