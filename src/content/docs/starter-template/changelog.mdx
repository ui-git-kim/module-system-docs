## v2.0.0

<Badge text="Breaking" variant="danger" />

**Unified Navigation Overrides**

Merged `sectionOverrides` into `navigationOverrides` for a simpler, unified API.

**Breaking Changes:**
- Removed `sectionOverrides` field from database schema
- Removed `GET/PATCH /api/v1/admin/section-overrides` endpoint
- Section overrides now live inside `navigationOverrides.sections` and `navigationOverrides.hiddenSections`

**Migration:**
Apps updating from v1.x need to run a database migration. The `navigationOverrides` JSON field now contains:
```typescript
{
  hidden: string[];                        // Hidden nav item IDs
  orderOverrides: Record<string, number>;  // Item order overrides
  sections: Record<string, SectionOverride>; // Section customisation
  hiddenSections: string[];                // Hidden section IDs
}
```

**Frontend:**
- Removed `useSectionOverridesAdmin` hook (use `useNavigationOverrides` instead)
- Removed `useGlobalSectionOverrides` hook (use `useGlobalNavigationOverrides().sections`)
- Updated `NavMain` to receive `navigationOverrides` prop instead of separate `sectionOverrides`

**Admin Panel:**
- Navigation Management page restructured with tabs: Main Navigation, Secondary, User Menu
- Sections integrated into Main Navigation tab (as collapsible containers)
- Removed separate Sections tab

---

## v1.12.0

**Registry-Based Sidebar Sections**

Major refactor of how sidebar sections work. Sections are now defined in the **navigation registry** by modules, with admin overrides for customisation.

**Navigation Registry:**
- Added `sidebarSection` property to navigation items (defaults to `'main'`)
- Added `registerSection()` method for explicit section registration
- Added `useRegistrySections()` and `useMainNavigationGrouped()` hooks
- Sections auto-create when referenced by items
- New 0-100 order convention for items and sections

**Admin Panel:**
- Navigation Management page now includes "Sections" tab
- Admins can customise section labels, toggle label visibility, reorder, and hide sections
- Admins cannot create/delete sections (module responsibility)
- Removed separate Sidebar Sections page (merged into Navigation)

**Backend:**
- Renamed `sidebarSections` to `sectionOverrides` in schema
- New endpoint: `GET/PATCH /api/v1/admin/section-overrides`
- Section overrides store only customisations, not full section definitions

**Architecture:**
- Registry (in-memory) + Admin Overrides (database) merged at render time
- Clean module install/uninstall - overrides persist harmlessly

## Versioning Infrastructure

Version bumps happen automatically for infrastructure changes. See [LLM Rules](/getting-started/llm-rules/) for the complete policy.

**Files requiring version bump:**
- `frontend/src/config/*.ts` - Registry files
- `frontend/src/lib/*.ts` - Utility libraries
- `backend/src/config/*.ts` - Registry files
- `backend/src/lib/*.ts` - Utility libraries
- `backend/src/middleware/*.ts` - Middleware
- `scripts/*.ps1`, `scripts/*.sh` - CLI scripts

**Bump commands:**
```bash
# Patch (bug fixes)
npm run template:version:patch

# Minor (new features)
npm run template:version:minor

# Major (breaking changes)
npm run template:version:major
```
