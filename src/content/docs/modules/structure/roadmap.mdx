import { Aside, Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This page outlines planned features and improvements for the Structure module. Items are grouped by priority.

<Aside type="note">
This roadmap reflects current plans and may change based on feedback and requirements from other modules.
</Aside>

## In Progress

Features currently being developed or designed.

### Table View for List Pages

**Status:** Foundations laid (column config exists)

The list page already supports grid and list views. Table view adds a column-based display:

- Column definitions configured per node type in admin
- Sortable columns with header click
- Field-based column rendering
- Responsive handling for narrow viewports

---

## Planned

Features planned for upcoming releases.

### Advanced Filtering

**Priority:** High

Expand filtering beyond select/multi-select dropdowns:

- Text field search filters
- Date range filters
- Number range filters
- Saved filter presets per user
- Filter state persisted in URL params

### Bulk Operations

**Priority:** High

Select multiple nodes and perform operations:

- Multi-select with checkboxes in list/grid views
- Bulk archive, delete, move operations
- Bulk field updates
- Select all / deselect all

### Node Templates

**Priority:** Medium

Pre-configured node templates for quick creation:

- Admin defines templates per node type
- Templates pre-fill fields, set defaults
- Users pick a template when creating a new node
- Template marketplace (share across apps)

### Published Nodes

**Priority:** Medium

Complete the publishing workflow:

- Draft/published state management
- Public URL generation with `publishedSlug`
- Public-facing read-only view
- Publish/unpublish actions in detail page
- Scheduled publishing

### Tree View Improvements

**Priority:** Medium

Enhanced hierarchical navigation:

- Inline node creation in tree view
- Drag-and-drop reparenting in tree
- Expand/collapse state persistence per user
- Tree search and filtering
- Keyboard navigation

### Custom Detail Page Layouts

**Priority:** Medium

Allow admins to configure detail page content beyond tabs:

- Custom widget placement on Overview tab
- Configurable info page sections
- Conditional sections based on field values
- Custom CSS/theme per node type

---

## Under Consideration

Ideas being evaluated for feasibility and demand.

### Node Versioning

Track changes to node data over time:

- Version history for field changes
- Diff view between versions
- Restore to previous version
- Audit trail per node

### Computed Fields

Fields that derive their value from other fields or related data:

- Formula fields (concatenation, arithmetic)
- Aggregation fields (count children, sum values)
- Lookup fields (pull from connected nodes)
- Auto-refresh on dependency changes

### Import/Export

Bulk data management:

- CSV import for node creation
- CSV/JSON export of node lists
- Field mapping during import
- Validation and error reporting

### Node Permissions

Granular access control per node:

- Owner, editor, viewer roles per node
- Inherit permissions from parent
- Share individual nodes with specific users
- Permission checks in API and UI

### Workflow Automation

Trigger actions based on node state changes:

- Status change triggers (e.g., archived → notify)
- Field value triggers (e.g., due date approaching)
- Integration with action registry
- Configurable via admin panel

---

## Planned Improvements

Enhancements to bring the module in line with the latest starter template conventions.

### Backend Zod Validation Refinement

**Priority:** Low

The generic route templates now include Zod schemas and validation. Structure-specific routes (in `backend/index.ts`) should also adopt Zod validation for all POST/PATCH endpoints for consistency.

### Structure-specific Filter/Action Hooks

**Priority:** Low

Filter and action registrations are now wired in but use generic placeholder examples. Define Structure-specific hooks (e.g., `structure.node.created`, `structure.node.beforeUpdate`) for other modules to subscribe to.

## Contributing Ideas

Have a feature request or improvement idea?

1. **Check existing items** - Review this roadmap and the [module repository](https://github.com/ui-git-kim/structure)
2. **Open an issue** - Describe the feature and use cases
3. **Discuss** - Engage with feedback to refine the proposal

<Aside type="tip">
When proposing features, consider how they integrate with the registry system. Features that other modules can extend through registries are preferred.
