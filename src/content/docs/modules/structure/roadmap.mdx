This page outlines planned features and improvements for the Structure module. Items are grouped by priority.

<Aside type="note">
This roadmap reflects current plans and may change based on feedback and requirements from other modules.
</Aside>

## In Progress

Features currently being developed or designed.

### Table View for List Pages

**Status:** Column registry complete, rendering in progress

The list page already supports grid and list views. Table view adds a column-based display:

- ✅ Column registry (`nodeColumnRegistry`) for module-provided columns
- ✅ Column definitions configured per node type in admin
- Sortable columns with header click
- Field-based column rendering
- Responsive handling for narrow viewports

### Bulk Operations

**Status:** Action registry foundations laid

- ✅ `nodeActionRegistry` with `location: 'bulk-action'` and `bulkHandler` support
- Multi-select with checkboxes in list/grid views
- Bulk archive, delete, move operations
- Bulk field updates
- Select all / deselect all

---

## Planned

Features planned for upcoming releases.

### Advanced Filtering

**Priority:** High

Expand on the new filter registry with more built-in filter types:

- ✅ Filter registry (`nodeFilterRegistry`) with client/server mode
- Text field search filters
- Date range filters
- Number range filters
- Saved filter presets per user
- Filter state persisted in URL params

### Node Templates

**Priority:** Medium

Pre-configured node templates for quick creation:

- Admin defines templates per node type
- Templates pre-fill fields, set defaults
- Users pick a template when creating a new node
- Template marketplace (share across apps)

### Published Nodes

**Priority:** Medium

Complete the publishing workflow:

- Draft/published state management
- Public URL generation with `publishedSlug`
- Public-facing read-only view
- Publish/unpublish actions in detail page
- Scheduled publishing

### Tree View Improvements

**Priority:** Medium

Enhanced hierarchical navigation:

- Inline node creation in tree view
- Drag-and-drop reparenting in tree
- Expand/collapse state persistence per user
- Tree search and filtering
- Keyboard navigation

### Custom Detail Page Layouts

**Priority:** Medium

Allow admins to configure detail page content beyond tabs:

- Custom widget placement on Overview tab
- Configurable info page sections
- Conditional sections based on field values
- Custom CSS/theme per node type

### Cross-Module Developer Experience

**Priority:** High

Improvements to make Structure easier and more powerful for other modules to integrate with. Identified from real-world integration work across modules like Builder, Tasks, and others.

#### NodeSelector Enhancements

- **Inline quick-create mode** — Built-in minimal creation form within the NodeSelector popover, so users can create a node without leaving the current dialog. Currently requires `onCreateClick` callback which forces the consuming module to implement its own creation flow
- **Dialog/modal variant** — Alternative `NodeSelector` rendered as a dialog instead of a popover, for use inside other dialogs where popover z-index and overflow issues arise
- **`onNodeCreated` callback** — Fire a callback after a node is created inline, with the new node auto-selected. Simplifies the consuming module's state management
- **Multi-select mode** — Allow selecting multiple nodes at once (e.g., linking a task to several projects). Return `string[]` instead of `string | null`

#### Frontend API Surface

- **`useNodeName(id)` hook** — Lightweight hook that resolves a node ID to its display name without fetching the full node object. Useful for badges, breadcrumbs, and labels throughout consuming modules
- **`useNodesByType(type)` hook** — Fetch all nodes of a given type for the current user. Common pattern that currently requires manual service calls
- **Export `StructureService` type** — Typed interface for the structure service, so consuming modules can type their `serviceRegistry.get('structure')` calls without importing internals
- **`useNodeAncestors(id)` hook** — Resolve the full parent chain for breadcrumb rendering in consuming modules

#### Backend API Surface

- **Frontend `structureService.createNode()`** — A frontend service method for programmatic node creation (not just via the admin/detail page UI). Allows modules like Builder to create project nodes inline
- **Typed action/filter contexts** — Export TypeScript interfaces for all action hook contexts (e.g., `NodeCreatedContext`, `NodeDeletedContext`) so consuming modules get autocomplete and type safety in their registrations

#### General DX

- **Integration testing utilities** — Provide mock/stub helpers for `serviceRegistry.get('structure')` so module developers can unit test their Structure integrations without a running database
- **Node field value access helper** — Simple utility to extract a typed field value from a node's data blob by field slug, handling missing fields gracefully

---

## Known Issues

No known issues at this time. All items from the v1.9.0 standards alignment have been resolved.

---

## Planned Improvements

### Server-Side Field Filtering

**Priority:** Medium

Field filters on the list page are applied client-side after fetching. Should pass filter parameters to the API and apply in Prisma query.

---

## Under Consideration

Ideas being evaluated for feasibility and demand.

### Node Versioning

Track changes to node data over time:

- Version history for field changes
- Diff view between versions
- Restore to previous version
- Audit trail per node

### Computed Fields

Fields that derive their value from other fields or related data:

- Formula fields (concatenation, arithmetic)
- Aggregation fields (count children, sum values)
- Lookup fields (pull from connected nodes)
- Auto-refresh on dependency changes

### Import/Export

Bulk data management:

- CSV import for node creation
- CSV/JSON export of node lists
- Field mapping during import
- Validation and error reporting

### Node Permissions

Granular access control per node:

- Owner, editor, viewer roles per node
- Inherit permissions from parent
- Share individual nodes with specific users
- Permission checks in API and UI

### Workflow Automation

Trigger actions based on node state changes:

- Status change triggers (e.g., archived → notify)
- Field value triggers (e.g., due date approaching)
- Integration with action registry
- Configurable via admin panel

## Contributing Ideas

Have a feature request or improvement idea?

1. **Check existing items** - Review this roadmap and the [module repository](https://github.com/ui-git-kim/structure)
2. **Open an issue** - Describe the feature and use cases
3. **Discuss** - Engage with feedback to refine the proposal

<Aside type="tip">
When proposing features, consider how they integrate with the registry system. Features that other modules can extend through registries are preferred.
