description: Visual interface for managing node types and structure configuration
---

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The Admin page provides a visual interface for managing node types and rendering templates without code changes. Access it at **Admin > App Structure**.

---

## Top-Level Tabs

The admin page has two top-level tabs:

- **Structure Types** — Create and configure node types (properties, fields, hierarchy, navigation)
- **Templates** — Configure how nodes render across views (cards, lists, detail headers, overview layouts) and manage module integrations

Both tabs share the same left pane type list. Selecting a type updates the right pane for whichever tab is active.

---

## Two-Pane Layout

The admin page uses a master-detail layout with explicit mode management:

- **Left pane** — Compact list of all node types with drag handles for reordering (shared between tabs)
- **Right pane** — Form editor for the selected type (Structure Types tab) or template configuration (Templates tab)

The admin page tracks its current mode explicitly: **list**, **create**, **edit**, or **duplicate**. This determines the form behaviour and available actions. The "New" button only appears on the Structure Types tab.

---

## Drag-to-Reorder

Node types can be reordered by dragging:

1. Grab the **grip handle** on the left of any type card
2. Drag to the desired position
3. Release to save - order persists automatically

The sort order affects display in navigation and list views.

---

## Configuration Tabs

When editing a node type, the form is organised into tabs:

### Basic Tab

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Slug | URL identifier (cannot change after creation) |
| Name / Plural | Display names |
| Description | Optional description |
| Icon | Lucide icon picker with search |
| Colour | Theme colour for the type |
| Show in main navigation | Whether this type appears in the sidebar |
| Navigation order | Position in the sidebar |

### Properties Tab

Configure entry-level features for nodes of this type.

**Entry Customisation:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Custom Slug | Allow entries to have custom URL-friendly slugs |
| Custom Colour | Allow entries to have their own colour |
| Custom Icon | Allow entries to choose their own icon |

**Entry Lifecycle:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Favourites | Allow users to mark entries as favourites for quick access |
| Archiving | Allow entries to be archived instead of deleted |
| Publishing | Enable draft/published workflow for entries |
| Manual Sort | Allow users to drag-and-drop to reorder entries |

### Fields Tab

Define custom data fields for nodes of this type.

**Supported field types:**
- Text, Text Area, Number
- Date, Date & Time
- Select, Multi-Select
- URL, Email
- Toggle (boolean)
- Secret (API keys - masked display)
- Media (file uploads)
- Node Reference (link to other nodes)

Each field can have:
- Label and placeholder
- Required toggle
- Description/help text
- Width (full or half)
- Type-specific options (e.g., select options, min/max for numbers)

### Hierarchy Tab

Configure how this type fits into the node hierarchy.

**Parent Relationships:**

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Can be created standalone | This type can exist at the root level without a parent |
| Can be nested inside same type | Allow nesting entries of this type inside each other |
| Allowed Parent Types | Which other types can contain entries of this type (click badges to toggle) |

**Child Relationships:**

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Can contain entries of same type | Allow entries of this type to contain children of the same type |
| Maximum Depth | Limit how deep the hierarchy can go (blank = unlimited) |
| Allowed Child Types | Which types can be nested inside entries of this type (click badges to toggle) |

<Aside type="tip" title="Allowed Parents/Children">
Click the type badges to toggle them on/off. Selected types appear highlighted. Leave empty to allow all types.
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution">
If an entry type cannot be created standalone and has no allowed parent types, users won't be able to create entries of this type.
</Aside>

### Pages Tab

Configure how this type appears in navigation and list/detail pages.

**Sidebar Entries:**

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Show in sidebar | Display entries of this type in a sidebar section |
| Section label | Header text for the sidebar section |
| Max entries | Maximum number of entries to show |
| Sort by | How to sort entries (manual, name, created, updated) |
| Filters | Which entries to include (favourites, recent, all) |

**Card Display with Live Preview:**

Configure how entries appear in list/grid views. A **live card preview** renders beside the settings so admins can see changes in real time.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Show description | Display the entry description on cards |
| Show icon | Display the entry icon on cards |
| Show colour | Display the entry colour indicator on cards |
| Show custom fields | Select which custom fields to display as badges on cards |

<Aside type="tip" title="Card Preview">
The `CardPreview` component renders a mock card using the current form state. Toggle settings and watch the preview update instantly - no need to save first.
</Aside>

**Page Navigation:**

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Navigation style | **Tabs** (horizontal tab bar), **Sidebar** (left navigation panel), or **None** (single content area) |
| Default tab | Which tab to show when opening an entry |

**Built-in Tabs:**

Toggle visibility of standard tabs:
- Overview (widgets from modules)
- Info (custom fields)
- Children (nested entries)
- Connections (related entries)
- Settings (entry configuration)

**List Page Configuration:**

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Default view | Grid, List, or Table |
| Default sort | Field to sort by initially |
| Show search | Display search bar |
| Show filters | Display filter controls |
| Filterable fields | Which custom fields appear as filter dropdowns |
| Columns | Column definitions for table view (field, label, width, sortable) |

<Aside type="note" title="Filterable Fields">
Only **select** and **multi-select** field types can be used as filter dropdowns. When configured, the list page automatically renders a dropdown for each filterable field, letting users narrow results by field values.
</Aside>

---

## Templates Tab

The Templates tab configures how nodes of each type render across all views. Select a type from the left pane to see its template configuration.

### Sub-tabs

| Tab | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **Card** | Card display in grid views — visibility toggles, extension slot management, live preview |
| **List** | List item display — icon, description, colour visibility |
| **Detail** | Detail page header — breadcrumb, icon, description, favourite, action buttons |
| **Overview** | Overview tab layout — single or two-column widget arrangement |
| **Module Integrations** | Control module-provided tabs, widgets, and card extensions per type |

### Card Template

Configure what appears on entry cards:
- Toggle built-in elements (description, icon, colour accent)
- Enable/disable each of the 5 card extension slots: **badge**, **action**, **header**, **content**, **footer**
- Live `CardPreview` updates as you toggle settings

### Module Integrations

Replace the old `hideTabs` text input. Provides a proper UI for:
- **Module Tabs** — Enable/disable, rename, and reorder module-provided tabs
- **Module Widgets** — Enable/disable and reorder overview tab widgets
- **Card Extensions** — Enable/disable, reassign slots, and reorder card badges/actions/content

<Aside type="tip">
Module integrations are discovered at render time from the registries. As modules are installed or removed, the integration list updates automatically.
</Aside>

### Standalone Templates

Templates can also be created as standalone, reusable entities via the API. A template defines rendering configuration for one view type (card, list, detail header, or overview). Node types reference templates by ID and can apply local overrides on top.

This pattern supports: create once → assign to many types.

---

## Actions

When editing an existing type, the header shows:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Duplicate** | Create a copy to use as a starting point (enters duplicate mode) |
| **Delete** | Remove the type (requires confirmation) |
