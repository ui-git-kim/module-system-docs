description: Visual interface for managing node types and structure configuration
---

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The Admin page provides a visual interface for managing node types without code changes. Access it at **Admin > App Structure**.

---

## Two-Pane Layout

The admin page uses a master-detail layout with explicit mode management:

- **Left pane** - Compact list of all node types with drag handles for reordering
- **Right pane** - Full form editor for the selected type

The admin page tracks its current mode explicitly: **list**, **create**, **edit**, or **duplicate**. This determines the form behaviour and available actions.

---

## Drag-to-Reorder

Node types can be reordered by dragging:

1. Grab the **grip handle** on the left of any type card
2. Drag to the desired position
3. Release to save - order persists automatically

The sort order affects display in navigation and list views.

## Configuration Tabs

### Hierarchy Tab

Configure how this type fits into the node hierarchy.

**Parent Relationships:**

| Maximum Depth | Limit how deep the hierarchy can go (blank = unlimited) |
| Allowed Child Types | Which types can be nested inside entries of this type (click badges to toggle) |

<Aside type="tip" title="Allowed Parents/Children">
Click the type badges to toggle them on/off. Selected types appear highlighted. Leave empty to allow all types.
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution">
If an entry type cannot be created standalone and has no allowed parent types, users won't be able to create entries of this type.
</Aside>

### Pages Tab

Configure how this type appears in navigation and list/detail pages.

**Sidebar Entries:**

| Filters | Which entries to include (favourites, recent, all) |

**Card Display with Live Preview:**

Configure how entries appear in list/grid views. A **live card preview** renders beside the settings so admins can see changes in real time.

|---------|-------------|
| Show description | Display the entry description on cards |
| Show icon | Display the entry icon on cards |
| Show colour | Display the entry colour indicator on cards |
| Show custom fields | Select which custom fields to display as badges on cards |

Only **select** and **multi-select** field types can be used as filter dropdowns. When configured, the list page automatically renders a dropdown for each filterable field, letting users narrow results by field values.
</Aside>
