# Module Roadmap

This page tracks every module in the system — from actively developed modules through to ideas on the horizon. It serves as the single source of truth for what exists, what's coming, and what's being considered.

<Aside type="tip">
Each module listed here includes enough context for a Claude Code session to pick it up using the [Create a New Module](/module-starter/building-modules/) prompt without needing extra explanation.
</Aside>

---

## The Vision

The Module System is WordPress for React SaaS — a registry-based architecture where self-contained modules can be installed, updated, and eventually managed directly from an admin dashboard.

The system builds **single-tenant SaaS applications designed for individuals and solo/small businesses**. These are focused, purpose-built tools — not enterprise platforms with complex org hierarchies and multi-tenancy. Think personal productivity apps, client-facing tools for freelancers, niche vertical SaaS for small business owners.

**Who builds with the system** is a separate question with two paths:

- **Developers** use the CLI workflow (`npx module-name init`) and the [Module Starter Template](/module-starter/) to create, customise, and publish modules.
- **Non-technical admins** will eventually be able to discover, install, configure, and update modules directly from the admin dashboard — just as WordPress admins browse and install plugins without touching a terminal.

The CLI is the developer path; the admin dashboard is the non-technical path to the same result.

---

## How to Read This Roadmap

Modules are grouped by status:

- **✅ Released** — Available and documented. Install with `npx`.
- **🔄 In Progress** — Actively being developed.
- **📋 Planned** — Committed to building. Design work may have started.
- **💡 Under Consideration** — Strong candidates. Not yet committed.
- **💭 Ideas** — Early-stage thinking. May or may not happen.

Each module entry includes:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Module ID** | The kebab-case identifier used in `module.ts` |
| **Priority** | High / Medium / Low |
| **Dependencies** | Other modules required first |
| **Complexity** | Small (1–2 days) / Medium (3–5 days) / Large (1–2 weeks) |
| **Status notes** | Current state and what needs to happen next |

---

## 🔄 In Progress

### Structure

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Module ID** | `structure` |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Complexity** | Large |
| **Status** | Near complete |
| **Description** | Organisational module for app structure — provides node-based hierarchy (folders, groups, categories) with admin configuration, pages, and reusable components. |
| **Registries** | navigationRegistry, dashboardRegistry, settingsPagesRegistry, adminPagesRegistry, routeRegistry, serviceRegistry |
| **Documentation** | [Structure Module →](/modules/structure/) |

### Billing

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Module ID** | `billing` |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Complexity** | Large |
| **Status** | Needs alignment check against recent starter template updates |
| **Description** | Stripe integration using hosted checkout and customer portal. Replaces the placeholder billing settings page. Handles subscription plans, payment methods, invoices, and webhook processing. Uses a dedicated Stripe account for SaaS-specific billing. |
| **Registries** | settingsPagesRegistry (replaces `billing` placeholder), dashboardRegistry, routeRegistry, serviceRegistry |
| **Third-party** | Stripe (hosted checkout, customer portal, webhooks) |
| **Env variables** | `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` |

<Aside type="note">
The billing module uses Stripe's hosted checkout and customer portal to minimise PCI compliance scope. Webhook handling is built in — this pattern may be extracted into a more general webhooks/API module later.
</Aside>

### Pickers

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Module ID** | `pickers` |
| **Priority** | Medium |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Status** | Midway through development |
| **Description** | Colour picker and icon picker components for use across modules. Provides consistent selection UI for user-facing customisation. |
| **Dependencies** | None |
| **Documentation** | [Pickers Module →](/modules/pickers/) |

### AI Core

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Module ID** | `ai-core` |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Complexity** | Large |
| **Status** | Needs alignment check against recent starter template updates |
| **Description** | Foundation AI module providing three processing depth levels (quick, standard, thorough) with a "describe observables, not inferences" philosophy. Uses Vercel AI SDK for provider flexibility. Other AI modules depend on this for shared infrastructure — token tracking, provider configuration, streaming utilities, and cost estimation. |
| **Registries** | settingsPagesRegistry, preferencesRegistry, routeRegistry, serviceRegistry, adminPagesRegistry |
| **Dependencies** | None (this is the AI foundation) |
| **Third-party** | Vercel AI SDK, configurable providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.) |
| **Env variables** | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` (provider-dependent) |

<Aside type="caution">
The AI Core module's processing depth system (quick/standard/thorough) is a key differentiator — tiered AI processing with configurable behaviour per depth level.
</Aside>

### AI Chat

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Module ID** | `ai-chat` |
| **Priority** | Medium |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Status** | Needs significant updating to work with current system conventions |
| **Description** | Conversational AI interface with chat history, streaming responses, conversation management, and configurable system prompts. Built on top of AI Core's infrastructure. |
| **Registries** | navigationRegistry, dashboardRegistry, routeRegistry, serviceRegistry |
| **Dependencies** | `ai-core` |

### Block Builder

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Module ID** | `block-builder` |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Complexity** | Large |
| **Status** | In active development (primary module for useFoundry) |
| **Description** | Drag-and-drop visual builder using shadcn/ui components. The main module powering the useFoundry application. Enables users to visually compose pages and layouts from a component library without writing code. Focused on **SaaS UI blocks** (dashboards, settings, data views, forms) rather than marketing-style blocks. Designer-down approach — make it look good and work well first. |
| **Registries** | navigationRegistry, routeRegistry, serviceRegistry |
| **Dependencies** | None |

### Block Builder Logic

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Module ID** | `block-builder-logic` |
| **Priority** | Medium |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Status** | In development (add-on for useFoundry) |
| **Description** | Add-on module for Block Builder that provides logic and interactivity capabilities — event handling, conditional rendering, data binding, and state management within visually composed layouts. |
| **Dependencies** | `block-builder` |

### Block Builder Style / Style

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Module ID** | `style` (TBC — may change from `block-builder-style`) |
| **Priority** | Medium |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Status** | Direction under review — may pivot to a standalone Tailwind/shadcn theme creator |
| **Description** | Visual Tailwind CSS classname builder. Originally scoped as a Block Builder add-on for useFoundry, but may evolve into a broader **style/theme module** — a shadcn/Tailwind theme creator usable in the admin panel, the Block Builder, and across the app generally. |
| **Dependencies** | None (standalone) or `block-builder` (if kept as add-on) |

<Aside type="tip">
**Decision needed:** Should this remain Block Builder-specific, or become a standalone style/theming module that the Block Builder also consumes? A standalone module would have broader utility — admins could customise the app's look and feel without the full Block Builder.
</Aside>

### Cog-Ingest

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Module ID** | `cog-ingest` |
| **Priority** | Medium |
| **Complexity** | Large |
| **Status** | Needs alignment check against recent starter template updates |
| **Description** | Ingest module for the Cog database engine. Handles data ingestion pipelines for the vector/semantic/graph database system. Processes and indexes content for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and semantic search. |
| **Registries** | adminPagesRegistry, routeRegistry, serviceRegistry |
| **Dependencies** | `ai-core` |

---

## 📋 Planned

### Document Management

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Module ID** | `document-management` |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Complexity** | Large |
| **Description** | Full document management system — multiple storage locations, file upload, folder organisation, file previews, sharing, and version history. Incorporates file storage adapters (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, local filesystem) and upload functionality as core parts of the module rather than separate modules. |
| **Registries** | navigationRegistry, dashboardRegistry, routeRegistry, serviceRegistry, adminPagesRegistry |
| **Dependencies** | None |
| **Decisions needed** | Storage adapter selection during init, preview rendering approach, maximum file sizes, document workflow states |

<Aside type="note">
This module subsumes what might otherwise be separate "file storage" and "file upload" modules. The storage adapters already exist as patterns in the system — this module formalises them into a complete document management experience.
</Aside>

### Notifications

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Module ID** | `notifications` |
| **Priority** | Medium |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Description** | In-app notification system with bell icon in header toolbar, notification drawer/panel, read/unread tracking, and notification preferences per category. Provides a service that other modules can call to create notifications (e.g., billing module notifies on payment failure, tasks module notifies on due dates). |
| **Registries** | headerToolbarRegistry, notificationPreferencesRegistry, routeRegistry, serviceRegistry |
| **Dependencies** | None |
| **Status notes** | Conceptual — hasn't been deeply designed yet. Needs decisions on real-time (WebSocket) vs polling, notification categories, and delivery channels (in-app only vs email too). |

### Cog-Display

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Module ID** | `cog-display` |
| **Priority** | Medium |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Description** | Display and exploration module for the Cog database engine. Provides UI for browsing, searching, and visualising vector/semantic/graph database records. Includes relationship graphs, similarity views, and search interfaces. |
| **Registries** | navigationRegistry, routeRegistry, serviceRegistry |
| **Dependencies** | `cog-ingest` |

### Roles & Permissions

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Module ID** | `rbac` |
| **Priority** | Medium |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Description** | Extends the existing user/admin/managed user role system with granular, configurable permissions. Define custom roles with specific permission sets, assign to users, and gate features/pages/API endpoints by permission. Provides middleware and hooks for permission checking throughout the app. |
| **Registries** | adminPagesRegistry, settingsPagesRegistry, routeRegistry, serviceRegistry, filterRegistry |
| **Dependencies** | None |

<Aside type="note">
The starter template already has `user`, `admin`, and `managed user` roles. This module adds the ability to create custom roles with fine-grained permissions beyond that built-in set.
</Aside>

### Tasks

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Module ID** | `tasks` |
| **Priority** | Medium |
| **Complexity** | Large |
| **Description** | A holistic task management system that goes beyond simple to-do lists. Connects to the user's personal state, tracks context (energy, focus, priorities), and provides AI-assisted day planning. Tasks can be linked to projects, have dependencies, recurring schedules, and time estimates. The planning assistant helps users organise their day based on task priorities, estimated effort, and personal state. |
| **Registries** | navigationRegistry, dashboardRegistry, routeRegistry, serviceRegistry |
| **Dependencies** | None (optional: `ai-core` for AI-assisted day planning) |

### Onboarding

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Module ID** | `onboarding` |
| **Priority** | Medium |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Description** | AI-assisted onboarding wizard for new users. Step-by-step setup flows with progress tracking, contextual guidance, and intelligent defaults based on user responses. The AI component can adapt the onboarding experience based on the user's role, goals, and experience level. Includes checklists and completion tracking. |
| **Registries** | dashboardRegistry (onboarding widget), routeRegistry, serviceRegistry |
| **Dependencies** | None (optional: `ai-core` for AI-assisted flows) |

### Brand Guidelines

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Module ID** | `brand-guidelines` |
| **Priority** | Low |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Description** | A living brand guidelines module — define and manage colours, typography, logos, tone of voice, and usage rules. Provides a reference that other modules (Block Builder, Style, Content) can consume to ensure brand consistency. Admin-configurable with export capability. |
| **Registries** | navigationRegistry, adminPagesRegistry, routeRegistry, serviceRegistry |
| **Dependencies** | None (optional: `style` for theme integration) |

### URL Shortener

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Module ID** | `url-shortener` |
| **Priority** | Low |
| **Complexity** | Small |
| **Description** | Create and manage shortened URLs with click tracking, analytics, and custom slugs. Useful for marketing campaigns, sharing, and link management within the app. |
| **Registries** | navigationRegistry, routeRegistry, serviceRegistry |
| **Dependencies** | None |

### AI Admin

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Module ID** | `ai-admin` |
| **Priority** | Medium |
| **Complexity** | Large |
| **Description** | Admin-facing AI management module. Configure conversation flows, set up app-based AI personas (system prompts, behaviour rules, tone), manage prompt templates, and monitor AI usage across the app. Provides the admin-side controls for all AI-powered features. |
| **Registries** | adminPagesRegistry, routeRegistry, serviceRegistry |
| **Dependencies** | `ai-core` |

### Prompt Engineering / Library

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Module ID** | `prompt-library` |
| **Priority** | Medium |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Description** | A curated prompt library with versioning, categorisation, A/B testing, and performance tracking. Users and admins can create, share, and refine prompts. Integrates with AI Core to use prompts across all AI-powered features. Includes prompt templates with variable substitution. |
| **Registries** | navigationRegistry, adminPagesRegistry, routeRegistry, serviceRegistry |
| **Dependencies** | `ai-core` |

### Sharing & Collaboration

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Module ID** | `sharing` |
| **Priority** | Medium |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Description** | Enables users to share content, documents, and resources with other users or via public links. Includes share permissions (view, comment, edit), share-by-link with optional expiry and password protection, and activity feeds showing who accessed shared items. Designed for individual users collaborating with clients or peers — not org-based multi-tenancy. |
| **Registries** | serviceRegistry, routeRegistry, headerToolbarRegistry (share button) |
| **Dependencies** | None |

<Aside type="tip">
This module is intentionally **not** multi-tenancy. It's designed for the solo business owner who needs to share a document with a client or collaborate with a freelancer — lightweight sharing without the overhead of teams, organisations, or workspace switching.
</Aside>

### Licensing

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Module ID** | `licensing` |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Complexity** | Large |
| **Description** | License key generation, validation, and management for SaaS products built with the module system. Covers the full licensing lifecycle: key generation, activation/deactivation, device or domain activation limits, expiry handling with grace periods, and a verification API that client apps call to check validity. Includes admin dashboard (view all licenses, customer usage, revocations) and customer self-service (view licences, manage activations). Can tie into the billing module to map licence keys to subscription plans/tiers. Optionally integrates with GitHub API for private repo access grants. |
| **Registries** | navigationRegistry, adminPagesRegistry, settingsPagesRegistry, dashboardRegistry, routeRegistry, serviceRegistry |
| **Dependencies** | None (optional: `billing` for plan-to-licence mapping) |

<Aside type="note">
This module will be dog-fooded — the Module System itself will use it to handle licensing for customers. This makes it one of the most battle-tested modules in the system from day one.
</Aside>

## 💡 Under Consideration

### Internationalisation (i18n)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Module ID** | `i18n` |
| **Priority** | Medium |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Description** | Multi-language support with language switcher component, translation file management, and locale-aware formatting (dates, numbers, currency). Provides utilities that other modules use to externalise their strings. |
| **Registries** | preferencesRegistry (language selection), headerToolbarRegistry (language switcher), serviceRegistry |
| **Dependencies** | None |
| **Decisions needed** | Translation library (i18next, FormatJS, or lighter approach), translation file format, server-side vs client-side translation |

### Marketing Pages

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Module ID** | `marketing` |
| **Priority** | Medium |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Description** | Pre-built, customisable page components for the public-facing side of the app — pricing tables, feature showcases, CTA blocks, FAQ sections. Focused on **SaaS-specific blocks** rather than generic marketing templates. Designer-down approach — polished and professional out of the box. Pricing table can auto-generate from billing module config. |
| **Registries** | routeRegistry (public routes) |
| **Dependencies** | None (optional: `billing` for pricing table data, `style` for theming) |

### Feedback & Feature Requests

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Module ID** | `feedback` |
| **Priority** | Low |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Description** | User feedback collection widget (embeddable button/modal), feature request board with voting, public roadmap display (list and kanban views), and admin management panel. |
| **Registries** | navigationRegistry, adminPagesRegistry, routeRegistry, serviceRegistry, headerToolbarRegistry (feedback button) |
| **Dependencies** | None |

### User Impersonation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Module ID** | `impersonation` |
| **Priority** | Low |
| **Complexity** | Small |
| **Description** | Allows admins to "log in as" any user for support and debugging purposes. Shows a clear banner when impersonating, with a button to return to admin. Logs all impersonation sessions for audit trail. |
| **Registries** | adminPagesRegistry, headerToolbarRegistry (impersonation banner), routeRegistry, serviceRegistry |
| **Dependencies** | None |

### Webhooks & API Management

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Module ID** | `webhooks` |
| **Priority** | Low |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Description** | Generalised webhook and API management system. Outgoing webhooks that fire on app events, incoming webhook handling (beyond what billing already provides), and API key management for programmatic access. Admin configuration for webhook endpoints, retry logic, and event filtering. |
| **Registries** | adminPagesRegistry, settingsPagesRegistry, routeRegistry, serviceRegistry |
| **Dependencies** | None |

<Aside type="note">
The billing module already handles Stripe webhooks. This module would extract and generalise that pattern — providing a framework for any module to register webhook events and for admins to configure external endpoints.
</Aside>

### Custom Domains

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Module ID** | `custom-domains` |
| **Priority** | Low |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Description** | Allow users to connect their own domains to published content (pages built with Block Builder, public-facing resources, etc.). DNS verification, SSL provisioning, and domain management UI. |
| **Registries** | settingsPagesRegistry, adminPagesRegistry, routeRegistry, serviceRegistry |
| **Dependencies** | None |

<Aside type="tip">
**Decision needed:** Some custom domain functionality may already exist within the Block Builder module. Consider whether to extract it into a standalone module that Block Builder and other publishing modules consume, or keep it Block Builder-specific.
</Aside>

### Integrations

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Module ID** | `integrations` |
| **Priority** | Medium |
| **Complexity** | Large |
| **Description** | Third-party service connections — Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, social platforms (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn), and other APIs relevant to the app being built. Uses the existing integrationsRegistry in the starter template. Each integration is a provider within the module, selectable during init. Particularly valuable for content management and CRM use cases. |
| **Registries** | integrationsRegistry, settingsPagesRegistry, routeRegistry, serviceRegistry |
| **Dependencies** | None |

<Aside type="note">
Additional social auth providers (beyond Neon Auth defaults) are currently limited by Neon Auth's beta status. As Neon Auth matures and adds provider support, this module can expand to include auth-level integrations alongside data-level ones.
</Aside>

### Email & Email Templates

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Module ID** | `email` |
| **Priority** | Medium |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Description** | Transactional and template-based email system. React-based email templates, SMTP/API provider abstraction (Resend, SendGrid, AWS SES, Nodemailer), template management in admin, and preview/testing tools. Follows the adapter pattern — common interface with swappable providers selected during `init`. Particularly relevant for apps that need user-facing email (CRM, newsletters, notifications). |
| **Registries** | adminPagesRegistry, routeRegistry, serviceRegistry |
| **Dependencies** | None |

### Data Export / Privacy

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Module ID** | `data-export` |
| **Priority** | Low |
| **Complexity** | Small |
| **Description** | Extended data export and privacy compliance tools. The starter template already includes a Data & Privacy page in user settings — this module extends that with comprehensive data export (JSON/CSV), automated account deletion workflows, consent management, and GDPR/privacy compliance tooling. |
| **Registries** | settingsPagesRegistry (extends existing), routeRegistry, serviceRegistry |
| **Dependencies** | None |

<Aside type="note">
The starter template's existing Data & Privacy settings page covers the basics. This module is only needed if the app requires more comprehensive privacy compliance.
</Aside>

---

## 💭 Ideas

Early-stage thinking. These may or may not become modules.

| Module | Description | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Calendar / Scheduling** | Visual calendar with event management, scheduling, availability tracking, and booking. Could integrate with Microsoft 365 / Google Calendar via the Integrations module. | Pairs well with Tasks module. Complexity depends on scope — simple event display vs full scheduling system. |
| **Audit Log** | Track and display all significant actions across the app — user changes, admin actions, data modifications. Searchable log with filters. | Pairs with RBAC for compliance. |
| **Realtime / WebSockets** | Shared infrastructure for realtime features — live updates, presence indicators, collaborative editing foundations. | Foundation module that Notifications, Sharing, and AI Chat would consume. |
| **Knowledge Base** | In-app help articles, searchable documentation, and support resources for end users. | The starter template already has a support placeholder. The system docs site covers developer documentation. This would be an in-app version for end users of apps built with the system. |
| **AI Text Editor** | Rich text editor with AI-powered features — tone rewriting, grammar correction, content expansion/compression, summarisation. | Depends on `ai-core`. Could use TipTap, Lexical, or Plate. May be part of Content Management rather than standalone. |

## Launch Minimum

The commercial release of the Module System will coincide with the launch of **useFoundry** — a real product built entirely with this system, serving as the proof that the architecture works at scale.

**Required for launch:**

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Starter Template | ✅ Ready | Auth, admin panel, user settings, dashboard, registry system |
| Module Starter Template | ✅ Ready | CLI workflow, scaffold, templates, versioning |
| Documentation Site | ✅ Live | saas.uniqueicon.com.au |
| Billing Module | 🔄 In progress | Needs alignment check, then complete and polish |
| Structure Module | 🔄 In progress | Near complete |
| useFoundry (showcase app) | 🔄 In progress | Block Builder + Logic + Style modules |
| Demo App | ❌ Needed | Clickable demo showing the system in action |
| Product Landing Page | ❌ Needed | Sales page with pricing, demo link, getting started |
| Licensing / Access Delivery | ❌ Needed | Private GitHub repo access mechanism |

**Not required for launch** (but high value for early growth):
- AI Core, AI Chat, Pickers — can ship as updates post-launch
- Licensing module — dog-food it once it's built, but manual delivery is fine for initial customers

## Admin Module Installation (Vision)

The long-term goal is a WordPress-style admin experience:

1. **Module Catalogue** — Admin panel page showing available modules with descriptions, screenshots, and compatibility info
2. **One-click Install** — Admin clicks "Install", module runs its init process in the background
3. **Configuration** — Post-install configuration wizard within the admin panel
4. **Updates** — Notification when module updates are available, with changelog preview and one-click update
5. **Dependencies** — Automatic dependency resolution (installing module A auto-installs required module B)
6. **Uninstall** — Clean removal with confirmation of what will be removed

<Aside type="caution">
Admin-installable modules require the module system to handle installation without CLI access. This means the init process (file generation, schema migration, registration) needs to run server-side. This is a significant architectural milestone that builds on top of the existing CLI workflow.
</Aside>

## Related Roadmaps

This page covers the **module inventory** — what modules exist and what's planned. The other parts of the system have their own roadmaps:

- [Starter Template Roadmap](/starter-template/roadmap/) — Planned features for the core template (layouts, admin components, permissions hooks, i18n foundations)
- [Module Starter Roadmap](/module-starter/roadmap/) — Planned features for the scaffolding tool (marketplace, template inheritance, testing utilities)
- [Structure Module Roadmap](/modules/structure/roadmap/) — Feature-level roadmap for the Structure module specifically
