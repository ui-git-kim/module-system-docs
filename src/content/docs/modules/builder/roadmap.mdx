## In Progress

Features currently being developed or designed.

### Builder Logic Module

**Status:** Design phase

Separate module (`builder-logic`) for adding interactivity to built components:

- Event bindings (onClick, onChange, etc.)
- State management integration
- Data source connections
- Conditional rendering rules

---

## Planned

Features planned for upcoming releases.

### Component Import/Export

**Priority:** High

Share components between projects and users:

- Export blocks as standalone shadcn registry items
- Import from external registries
- Version tracking for imported components
- Conflict resolution for name collisions

### Undo/Redo

**Priority:** High

Canvas editing history:

- Undo/redo stack for block tree changes
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z)
- History panel showing recent changes

### Builder Style Module

**Priority:** Medium

Separate module (`builder-style`) for visual styling:

- Tailwind class picker with live preview
- Theme generator for consistent design tokens
- Style presets and templates
- Responsive style overrides

### Multi-Block Canvas

**Priority:** Medium

Work with multiple blocks simultaneously:

- Split canvas view
- Cross-block drag and drop
- Collection-level editing
- Shared component references

---

## Under Consideration

Ideas being evaluated for feasibility and demand.

### AI-Assisted Building

Use AI to generate or suggest component compositions:

- Natural language to component tree
- Property suggestions based on context
- Layout recommendations
- Accessibility improvements

### Collaborative Editing

Real-time multi-user editing:

- Cursor presence indicators
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
- Change attribution

---

## Known Issues

Technical debt and minor issues to be addressed.

| Issue | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Registry service component mappings are incomplete** | Low priority | `registry.service.ts` only maps common shadcn components for code generation; extensible but could cover more |
