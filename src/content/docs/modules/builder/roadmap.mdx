This page outlines planned features and improvements for the Block Builder module. Items are grouped by priority.

<Aside type="note">
This roadmap reflects current plans and may change based on feedback and requirements from other modules.
</Aside>

## In Progress

Features currently being developed or designed.

### Builder Logic Module

**Status:** Design phase

Separate module (`builder-logic`) for adding interactivity to built components:

- Event bindings (onClick, onChange, etc.)
- State management integration
- Data source connections
- Conditional rendering rules

---

## Planned

Features planned for upcoming releases.

### Component Import/Export

**Priority:** High

Share components between projects and users:

- Export blocks as standalone shadcn registry items
- Import from external registries
- Version tracking for imported components
- Conflict resolution for name collisions

### Undo/Redo

**Priority:** High

Canvas editing history:

- Undo/redo stack for block tree changes
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z)
- History panel showing recent changes

### Builder Style Module

**Priority:** Medium

Separate module (`builder-style`) for visual styling:

- Tailwind class picker with live preview
- Theme generator for consistent design tokens
- Style presets and templates
- Responsive style overrides

### Multi-Block Canvas

**Priority:** Medium

Work with multiple blocks simultaneously:

- Split canvas view
- Cross-block drag and drop
- Collection-level editing
- Shared component references

---

## Under Consideration

Ideas being evaluated for feasibility and demand.

### AI-Assisted Building

Use AI to generate or suggest component compositions:

- Natural language to component tree
- Property suggestions based on context
- Layout recommendations
- Accessibility improvements

### Collaborative Editing

Real-time multi-user editing:

- Cursor presence indicators
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
- Change attribution

---

## Known Issues

Technical debt and minor issues to be addressed.

| Issue | Priority | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Hardcoded `usefoundryui.app` domain** | High | Domain is hardcoded in `registry.routes.ts` error messages, `registrations.ts` URL construction, and `registry.service.ts`. Should be environment-driven for deployment flexibility |
| **VERSION file out of sync** | High | `VERSION` file contains `1.4.19` while module is at `1.5.57`. Needs investigation — may be scaffold version vs module version |
| **Inconsistent error state types in hooks** | Medium | Frontend hooks mix `Error` objects and `string` messages in error state. Should standardise on one pattern |
| **Unguarded console.log in admin settings** | Medium | `AdminComponentsPage` has an unguarded `console.log` in the save handler. Should be removed or gated behind `import.meta.env.DEV` |
| **`any` types in preview renderer** | Low | Three `any` usages in `ui/component-map.ts` for dynamic component discovery. Have eslint-disable comments but could use `unknown` |
| **Registry service component mappings are incomplete** | Low | `registry.service.ts` only maps common shadcn components for code generation; extensible but could cover more |
| **TODO: Tree panel view** | Low | `TreePanel.tsx` has a TODO comment for implementing tree panel view |
