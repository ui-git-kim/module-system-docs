## Known Issues

Issues discovered but not yet resolved.

| Issue | Severity | Where | Workaround |
|-------|----------|-------|------------|
| Registry service component mappings are incomplete | Low | `registry.service.ts` — `getImportForType()` only maps common shadcn components | Extensible but needs more component mappings for full code generation coverage |
| Tree panel is a placeholder | Low | `TreePanel.tsx` — needs a full tree view with expand/collapse and drag reorder | Use the canvas panel for tree navigation |
| No undo/redo support | Medium | Builder canvas — no history stack for block tree changes | Save frequently; use browser back if needed |
| Icon picker limited to Lucide | Low | `IconPicker.tsx` — only supports Lucide icons in the picker UI, despite configurable icon library for code output | Use string input for non-Lucide icon names |

---

## Planned Improvements

### Short-term (Next Version)

**Undo/Redo Stack**
- Add undo/redo support for block tree changes
- Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z
- History panel showing recent operations
- *Context:* The `useBuilder` hook manages block state — add a history array alongside `block` state. Each `setBlock` call pushes to history. Limit to ~50 entries.

**Tree Panel Implementation**
- Full hierarchical tree view with expand/collapse
- Drag-and-drop reorder within the tree
- Right-click context menu (delete, duplicate, wrap)
- Visual indicators for containers vs. elements
- *Context:* `TreePanel.tsx` exists as a placeholder. Use a recursive tree component with `@dnd-kit/sortable` for reorder.

### Medium-term (Upcoming)

**Component Import/Export**
- Export blocks as standalone shadcn registry items
- Import from external shadcn registries
- Version tracking for imported components
- Conflict resolution for name collisions
- *Context:* The registry JSON format is already defined in `registry.service.ts`. Needs a frontend UI for browsing external registries and an import resolution flow.

**Builder Logic Module**
- Separate module (`builder-logic`) for adding interactivity
- Event bindings (onClick, onChange, etc.)
- State management integration
- Data source connections
- Conditional rendering rules
- *Context:* This will be a new module that depends on `builder`. It should extend the property panel with a "Logic" tab (order 20) and the code generation registry with event handler imports and prop transforms. Store event bindings alongside block data.

**Enhanced Code Generation**
- Complete import mappings for all shadcn components
- Support for custom component libraries
- Code formatting with Prettier
- Multiple output formats (React, Vue in future)
- *Context:* Currently `registry.service.ts` has a limited `shadcnComponents` map. Expand it to cover all components in the `native_component` table dynamically.

**Multi-Library Icon Picker**
- Extend `IconPicker` to support all configured icon libraries (Tabler, Phosphor, Remix, Hugeicons)
- Load icon sets dynamically based on `shadcn:icon-library` config
- *Context:* Currently the picker only renders Lucide icons. The icon library config affects code output but not the picker UI.

### Long-term / Ideas

**Builder Style Module**
- Separate module (`builder-style`) for visual styling
- Tailwind class picker with live preview
- Theme generator for consistent design tokens
- Style presets and templates
- Responsive style overrides per breakpoint
- *Context:* Should register a "Style" tab (order 30) in the property panel tab registry and use `transformProps` in the code generation registry to apply className modifications.

**Multi-Block Canvas**
- Work with multiple blocks simultaneously on a split canvas
- Cross-block drag-and-drop
- Collection-level editing with entry point management
- Shared component references across blocks

**AI-Assisted Building**
- Natural language to component tree conversion
- Property suggestions based on context and common patterns
- Layout recommendations based on content type
- Accessibility improvement suggestions

**Collaborative Editing**
- Real-time multi-user editing with cursor presence
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
- Change attribution and activity feed
