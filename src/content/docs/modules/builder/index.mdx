import { Aside, Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The **Block Builder** module provides a visual component builder for useFoundryUI. It enables drag-and-drop composition of UI components, live preview, property editing, and code generation with shadcn registry output.

<Aside type="note">
This module requires the [Structure](/modules/structure/) module for project integration.

- Save/load blocks via API with changelog history
- Database-driven native component registry with seed data
- Block categories (user-created folders)
- Block collections (multi-block compositions)
- Dashboard widget and header toolbar integration
- Project-scoped blocks with shadcn namespace per project
- Global blocks available across all projects
- Structure module integration (blocks tab/widget on projects)

## Architecture

The builder follows a config-driven approach. Block types are defined in a database-driven component registry (`native_component` table), not hardcoded. Components are categorised:

| Category | Can Have Children? | Examples |
|----------|-------------------|----------|
| **Containers** | Yes | Card, Dialog, Accordion, ScrollArea |
| **Elements** | No | Button, Input, Badge, Avatar |
| **Primitives** | Varies | Div, Icon |

### Registry Output

Generates shadcn-compatible registry JSON served via per-project URLs:

```
https://usefoundryui.app/r/[project-id]
```

### Philosophy

"Design down to dev, not dev up to design" — users see what they're building before code is generated.
