description: What is the Module System and how to get started
---

## What is this?

A registry-based architecture for building React applications. Instead of monolithic apps, you build with:

1. **Starter Template** - The app foundation with registries, authentication, and shell
2. **Module Starter** - Template for creating installable modules
3. **Modules** - Self-contained features that plug into any app built from the starter

## The Problem

| Issue | Traditional Approach |
|-------|---------------------|
| Features scattered across codebase | Hunt through multiple folders |
| Adding features requires modifying core code | Touch many files for one feature |
| Hard to reuse features across apps | Copy-paste and hope |
| Inconsistent patterns | Every feature structured differently |

## The Solution

| Issue | Module System Approach |
|-------|----------------------|
| Features scattered | Each module is self-contained |
| Modifying core code | Modules register themselves via registries |
| Hard to reuse | Modules install via CLI into any app |
| Inconsistent patterns | Standardised module structure |

## Quick Start

Run the create script from the template folder:

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
.\create-app.ps1
```

```bash
# macOS/Linux
./create-app.sh
```

The script walks you through the entire setup interactively. See [Create Script Walkthrough](/starter-template/create-script/) for what each step does.

## What the Script Does

1. **Clones the template** - Full git history preserved for easy updates
2. **Installs dependencies** - Frontend, backend, and shadcn components
3. **Creates .env files** - Prompts for your database credentials
4. **Sets up the database** - Runs Prisma migrations
5. **Creates initial commit** - Your app is ready to develop

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, you need:

- **Node.js 20+** - [Download](https://nodejs.org/)
- **A Neon account** - [Create free account](https://neon.tech)
- **Neon project set up** - See [Neon Database Setup](/getting-started/neon-setup/)

:::tip[Set up Neon first]
The create script will prompt for your database URLs and auth URL. Have these ready from your Neon dashboard before running the script.
:::

## After Setup

Once the script completes:

```bash
cd your-app-name
npm run dev
```

Your app will be running at:
- **Frontend:** http://localhost:5173
- **Backend:** http://localhost:YOUR_PORT (port chosen during setup)
