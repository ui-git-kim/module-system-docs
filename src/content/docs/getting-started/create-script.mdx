import { Steps, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The create script (`create-app.ps1` on Windows, `create-app.sh` on macOS/Linux) sets up a new app interactively. This guide explains each prompt.

---

## Before You Start

Have these ready from your [Neon dashboard](https://console.neon.tech):

1. **Prisma snippet** - Go to Connection Details → Prisma tab → Copy snippet
2. **Auth URL** - From the Neon Auth section

:::tip[Credentials are optional]
You can skip the database and auth prompts during setup. The script creates placeholder comments in `.env` files that you can fill in later.
:::

---

## Running the Script

From the template folder:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Windows">
    ```powershell
    .\create-app.ps1
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="macOS/Linux">
    ```bash
    ./create-app.sh
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

---

## Step 1: App Name

```
Enter your app name: my-saas-app
```

This becomes:
- Your app's display name
- Folder name (converted to kebab-case: `my-saas-app`)
- Package name in `package.json`

---

## Step 2: Output Location

```
Output Location
Where should the app be created?
Default: C:\Users\you\ReactApps
Output directory (press Enter for default):
```

The script creates the app in a sibling folder to the template by default. Press Enter to accept, or specify a different path.

---

## Step 3: Database URLs

The script asks you to paste the Prisma snippet from Neon:

```
Database Setup (Neon)
Get this from your Neon dashboard (https://console.neon.tech)
Go to: Connection Details -> Prisma tab -> Copy the snippet

Paste the ENTIRE snippet (both lines). It looks like:
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://...@ep-xxx-pooler.../neondb?..."
# DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED="postgresql://...@ep-xxx.../neondb?..."

Or press Enter to skip (you'll need to configure .env manually later)

Paste your Neon snippet (press Enter when done):
```

### Getting the Neon Snippet

<Steps>
1. Go to [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech)
2. Select your project
3. Click **Connection Details**
4. Select the **Prisma** tab
5. Make sure **Connection pooling** is enabled
6. Click **Copy snippet**
7. Paste the entire snippet into the terminal
8. Press Enter to confirm
</Steps>

The script automatically extracts both URLs:
- **Pooled URL** (with `-pooler`) - for app queries
- **Direct URL** (without `-pooler`) - for migrations

```
Parsed URLs:
  Pooled:  ...ep-xxx-pooler.ap-southeast-2...
  Direct:  ...ep-xxx.ap-southeast-2...
```

### Skipping Database Setup

Press Enter without pasting anything to skip. You'll need to:
1. Open `backend/.env` after setup
2. Uncomment and fill in `DATABASE_URL` and `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL`
3. Run `npx prisma migrate dev --name init`

---

## Step 4: Auth URL

```
Neon Auth Setup
Get this from Neon Console -> Auth section
Example: https://your-project-id.neonauth.ap-southeast-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb/auth

Or press Enter to skip (you'll need to configure .env manually later)
Enter your NEON_AUTH_URL:
```

Get this from your Neon project's Auth section. It's used for JWT token validation.

### Skipping Auth Setup

Press Enter to skip. You'll need to add `NEON_AUTH_URL` to both:
- `frontend/.env` as `VITE_NEON_AUTH_URL`
- `backend/.env` as `NEON_AUTH_URL`

---

## Step 5: Backend Port

```
Backend Port
Choose a unique port for this app's API server
Enter backend port (default: 3100):
```

Choose a unique port for this app's backend API. The default is 3100, but if you have multiple apps running, use different ports (3101, 3102, etc.).

The frontend port is handled automatically by Vite - it will use the next available port if 5173 is taken.

---

## Step 6: App Remote (Optional)

```
App Repository (Optional)
If you've created a GitHub repo for your app, enter the URL.
Or press Enter to skip (you can publish via VS Code later)
Example: https://github.com/yourusername/my-app
Enter your app's git remote URL:
```

If you've created a GitHub/GitLab repo for your app, enter the URL here. Otherwise, skip and set it up later via VS Code's "Publish Branch" feature.

---

## Confirmation

Before doing any work, the script shows a summary:

```
===================================================
  Ready to create: my-saas-app
===================================================

  Location:     C:\Users\you\ReactApps\my-saas-app
  Backend port: 3100
  Database:     Configured
  Auth:         Configured
  App remote:   None (local only)

Proceed? (Y/n):
```

Review the settings and press Enter (or `Y`) to proceed, or `n` to cancel.

---

## What Happens Next

The script automatically:

1. **Clones the template** with full git history
2. **Sets up remotes** - `template-upstream` for updates
3. **Removes template-only files** (create-app scripts, etc.)
4. **Updates package.json** with your app name
5. **Installs all dependencies** (frontend, backend, shadcn)
6. **Creates .env files** with your credentials (or placeholders)
7. **Runs Prisma generate** to create the database client (if configured)
8. **Runs Prisma migrate** to set up database tables (if configured)
9. **Creates an initial commit**

---

## After Completion

```
===================================================
  Success! Created my-saas-app
===================================================

Location: C:\Users\you\ReactApps\my-saas-app

Next steps:

  cd "C:\Users\you\ReactApps\my-saas-app"
  npm run dev

Your app will be running at:
  Frontend: http://localhost:5173
  Backend:  http://localhost:3100

To update from template later:
  git fetch template-upstream
  git merge template-upstream/main

Documentation: https://saas.uniqueicon.com.au

Open in VS Code? (Y/n):
```

If you skipped database or auth setup, the script also shows what you need to configure manually.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Prisma migrate failed"

Check your `DATABASE_URL` and `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL` are correct. The pooled URL won't work for migrations - make sure you have the direct URL (without `-pooler`).

### "shadcn init failed"

You can run this manually later:
```bash
cd frontend
npx shadcn@latest init --yes --defaults
npx shadcn@latest add sidebar breadcrumb separator dropdown-menu avatar collapsible badge card dialog tooltip --yes
```

### Script exits unexpectedly

The script keeps the window open on errors. Check the error message and verify your inputs.

### Can't parse Neon snippet

Make sure you're copying the complete snippet from the Prisma tab, including both lines (the pooled URL and the commented unpooled URL).

---

## Git Structure After Setup

Your new app has:

| Remote | Points To | Push? |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| `template-upstream` | Local template folder | No (disabled) |
| `origin` | Your app repo (if provided) | Yes |

To push to GitHub later:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/you/your-app.git
git push -u origin main
```
