## What is this?

A module system for building React applications. Instead of monolithic apps, you build with:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Starter Template" icon="rocket">
    The foundation app with registries, authentication, and shell components.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Module Starter" icon="puzzle">
    Template for creating installable modules.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Modules" icon="open-book">
    Self-contained features that install via CLI: billing, AI, content management, and more.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
